# CloverAddictivePatches

A collection of many toggleable quality-of-life improvements for CloverPit. Tweak FOV, skip repetitive dialogues, peek into drawers, and smooth out rough edges.

## Changelog

### v1.0.7 — Game Update Compatibility Fix (2026 update)

This release restores compatibility after the CloverPit 2026 update.

**What changed in the game:**

- `MainMenuScript` gained `MFunc_ReducedFlashing` — Flashing Lights Reduction is now a native game setting. The accessibility menu gained a new element at index 4, shifting all subsequent mod-injected elements up by one.
- `Data.settings` changed from a public field to a property.
- `GameplayMaster.DeathStep` enum gained a new `startFalling` value between `lookAtTrapdoor` and `falling`.
- `GameplayMaster.InterestsAndTicketsPhase` enum gained a new `beforeInterestsAndClovers` value.

**Fixes applied:**

1. **`Patches/MainMenuAdditions.cs` — Accessibility menu index shift**: The mod previously injected a Flashing Lights toggle at index 4 and a FOV option at index 5. The game now handles Flashing Lights natively at index 4. Updated `SetFlashingLightsText` to read Back text from `optionTexts[5]` (was `[4]`), add the FOV element at index 6 (was 5), and write text accordingly. Removed the mod's Flashing Lights element injection entirely.
2. **`Patches/MainMenuAdditions.cs` — `InterceptMenuSelection` accessibility section**: Removed the index 4 intercept for Flashing Lights (now handled natively by `MFunc_ReducedFlashing`). Updated indices 5 and 6 for FOV and Back respectively.
3. **`Utilities/ReflectionCache.cs` — `Data.settings` field→property**: `DataCache.Initialize()` now falls back to `GetProperty` when `GetField("settings")` returns null, maintaining compatibility across both old and new game versions.
4. **`Plugin.cs`**: Bumped version to 1.0.7; updated `MainMenuAdditionsPatch` config description to reflect that Flashing Lights is now a native game setting.

## What's Included

### Camera & FOV
- **Adjustable FOV**: Configurable in **Mod Options**, Accessibility, or through F1/F2 keys (60-110°)

- **Instant Restart**: No camera animations when manually restarting
- **Skip Trapdoor Warnings**: Skips trapdoor shake cutscene
- **Reduced Skip Delays**: Dialogues/cutscenes skippable faster (0.5s → 0.1s)

- **Skip Intro**: Bypass startup sequences

### Inventory & Drawers
- **Drawer Peek**: Hover over drawers to see them open slightly
- **Quick Swap**: "Swap with [Item]" options in equipped powerup menus

- **In-Game Mod Options**: Configure patches on the fly from Main Menu → Settings

All features are toggleable. Most can be configured in-game via the new **Mod Options** menu (under Main Menu → Settings).

## Installation

### First Time Setup

1. **Install BepInEx**
   - Download [BepInEx 5 (x64)](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) (get the `BepInEx_x64_*.zip`)
   - Extract the zip into your CloverPit game folder (where `CloverPit.exe` is)
   - Run the game once, then close it (this generates BepInEx folders)

2. **Install the Mod**
   - Download the latest `CloverAddictivePatches.dll` from [Releases](../../releases)
   - Place it in `BepInEx/plugins/` (create the `plugins` folder if it doesn't exist)

3. **Launch and Configure**
   - Start CloverPit
   - Open Main Menu (Esc) → Settings → **Mod Options** (new menu at the bottom)
   - Toggle patches as desired

### Configuration

**Recommended:** Use the in-game **Mod Options** menu (Main Menu → Settings). Changes apply immediately.

**Advanced:** Edit `BepInEx/config/io.github.failspy.qualityclover.cfg` directly. Requires game restart.

**Default FOV:** Set your preferred FOV in the config file (`PlayerFOV = 80` by default). F1/F2 keys adjust from there.

## Troubleshooting

- **Mod not loading?** Check `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` for errors. Make sure BepInEx initialized (you should see a console window on launch).
- **Specific patch not working?** Verify it's enabled in **Mod Options** or the config file.
- **Config changes not applying?** In-game **Mod Options** changes apply live. Manual config edits require restart.

## Building From Source

### Linux / WSL

If you want to compile the mod yourself:

1. Clone this repo
2. Install Mono (if not already installed): `sudo apt install mono-mcs` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `sudo pacman -S mono` (Arch)
3. Run `./compile.sh`

The script will automatically detect your CloverPit installation by searching Steam library folders. If auto-detection fails, set the `CLOVERPIT_DIR` environment variable:

```bash
export CLOVERPIT_DIR="/path/to/CloverPit"
./compile.sh
```

Or as a one-liner:
```bash
CLOVERPIT_DIR="/path/to/CloverPit" ./compile.sh
```

### Windows

A native Windows build script (`compile.bat`) is provided for compiling without WSL:

1. Clone this repo
2. Install Visual Studio Build Tools or the .NET SDK (for `csc.exe`)
3. Run `compile.bat` from Command Prompt or PowerShell

The batch script auto-detects your CloverPit installation. If needed, override with:
```cmd
set CLOVERPIT_DIR=C:\path\to\CloverPit
compile.bat
```

The script compiles all patches and copies the DLL to `BepInEx/plugins/`.
